# Simple-Game
This is a simple game made for one my assignments in programming.

Let's play soccer!

This game was created using a software called Processing 4. It was made using Java and applied shapes.

The game is a bit buggy, but functional. I will possibly edit the game one day again.

First player to reach a score of 6 wins the game. The controls are in the game.
